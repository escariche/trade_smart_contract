    Arrays in Solidity are indexed from 0, so the ID value will need to be between 0 and 15.
    We use the require() statement to ensure the the ID is within range.

    If the ID is in range, we then add the address that made the call to our adopters array.
    The address of the person or smart contract who called this function is denoted by msg.sender.
